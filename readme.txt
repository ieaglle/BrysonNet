I've just started to learn neural networks and "BrysonNet" is my first attempt to create them using C#.

In the future I'd like to create some handwritten/typed text recognition and image processing using this project.

Current features:
 - it's possible to create neural network with custom numbers of neurons;
 - from one to three hidden layers available (in future will be more if necessary);
 - weights randomizing;
 - network pulsing;
 - backpropagation training;
 - XOR operation example is included.

TODO:
 [x] add weight ranges for randomizing (e.g. -1 to 1, or -0,5 to 0,5 etc.);
 [x] add error and previous changes arrays;
 [x] implement back propagation training (more in future);
 [ ] add possibility to store and retreive trained weights from a file, probably in XML file; 
 [ ] add other networks types such as Hopfield network or even Recurrent neural
 network.
