I've just started to learn neural networks and BrysonNet is my first attempt to create them using C#.

In the future I'd like to create some handwritten/typed text recognition and image processing using this project.

Current features:
 - it's possible to create neural network with custom numbers of neurons;
 - from one to three hidden layers available (in future will be more if necessary);
 - weights randomizing;
 - network pulsing.

TODO:
 - add weights range for randomizing (e.g. -1 to 1, or -0,5 to 0,5 etc.);
 - implement training (back propagation);
 - add other networks types such as Hopfield network or even Recurrent neural network.
